# wmbus-client
Wireless M-Bus client is a JavaScript library for reading, logging, processing
and distributing wM-Bus meter telegrams.

This experimental IoT-project aims to provide basic meter reading and reporting.
Collected data can be distributed to external services over internet, making your
environment to be part of Internet of Things.

### Supported meters and readers
At the moment it supports Kamstrup Multical 21 water meters and AMBER wM-Bus Modules (AMB8426-M AMB8626-M AMB3626-M AMB3636-M).
Please contribute to get more readers and meters.
